# Splekbot

This repository contains the source code for "Splekbot," a game that was created for the UCLA ACM Studio Winter 2020 - Spring 2021 game development projects. The project build, description, and list of contributors can be found at https://aaisara12.itch.io/splekbot.


## Project Files
Unity collab was the orignal source control method used to build this project. In this Git version, all project assets other than source code have been removed due to large file sizes and use of third-party art assets. This repository alone cannot be opened in Unity.
